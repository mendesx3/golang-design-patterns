# SOLID Principles in Go (Golang)

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that aim to make software more maintainable, flexible, and understandable. These principles can be applied to Go (Golang) just as effectively as in other programming languages.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each module, class, or function should have only one reason to change.
- In Go, this principle encourages creating small, focused functions or methods that do one thing and do it well.

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- In Go, this can be achieved by using interfaces and allowing new implementations to extend behavior without changing existing code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- In Go, this principle promotes creating interfaces that define behavior in a way that derived types can be used interchangeably.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- In Go, this means creating small and specific interfaces that contain only the methods relevant to the implementing types.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- In Go, this is achieved by defining interfaces and having concrete types depend on the interfaces rather than the other way around.
